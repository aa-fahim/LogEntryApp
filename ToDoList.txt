Implement features:
    - Added barcode scanner, works fine but does nothing with data read at this point
    - You can't change logID and you shouldn't be able to so maybe change that from textInput to text
    - Change background color of AppButton, change color of TextIputForm placeholder text

NPM RUN DEV TO START SERVER
Tutorial that helped me build the RESTful APIs, extremely useful

Future updates:
    - Implement Calendar Picker in future updates
    - Maybe add Alert to FindLogScreen if log is not found
    - Maybe change EntryResultScreen to an Alert if entry log is successful
    - Date is stored in ISO 8064 format, so I always have to take first 10 chars in the javascript files, can be slow if theres a lot 
    of entries in timesheetscreen so find out if I can create a sql query that takes the first 10 chars or change format in mysql database
