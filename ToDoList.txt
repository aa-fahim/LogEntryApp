Implement features:
    - Make submit button nicer (same one is used across all screens as of now, so make a component)
    - Maybe add Alert to FindLogScreen if log is not found
    - Add something to logEntry screen after log has been successfully entered
    - Added barcode scanner, works fine but does nothing with data read at this point
    - In Viewlogscreen, if dateOut and employeeOut are null/undefined, the textInput for those variable do not show(are blank, and not visible)
    - I think the sql query getdate, etc messes up the format for the dates in the database
