Implement features:
    - View all entires in grid format (is this even possible? so many questions)
        - What happens if theres too many features, would have to scroll screen sideways to see all of them (name, age, hair is only 3 but what happens if there's more)
        - Possibly infinite amount of entires, so would have to scroll the screen vertically, this causes performance issues too if theres too much data
    - Add barcode camera (just add camera for now, wait for further instructions from Warren)
    - Make submit button nicer (same one is used across all screens as of now, so make a component)
    - In ViewLogScreen, make TextInput placeholder texts darker so it looks like they are filled in already when you would normally fill them in, in other screens
