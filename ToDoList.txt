Implement features:
    - Make submit button nicer (same one is used across all screens as of now, so make a component)
    - Added barcode scanner, works fine but does nothing with data read at this point
    - Date is stored in ISO 8064 format so change to Date(limit 10 chars) or change Date to String
    - You can't change logID and you shouldn't be able to so maybe change that from textInput to text
    - Table in ios device, the entries do not align properly with the data

NPM RUN DEV TO START SERVER

Future updates:
    - Implement Calendar Picker in future updates
    - Maybe add Alert to FindLogScreen if log is not found
    - Maybe change EntryResultScreen to an Alert if entry log is successful
