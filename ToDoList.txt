Implement features:
    - View all entires in grid format (is this even possible? so many questions)
        - What happens if theres too many features, would have to scroll screen sideways to see all of them (name, age, hair is only 3 but what happens if there's more)
        - Possibly infinite amount of entires, so would have to scroll the screen vertically, this causes performance issues too if theres too much data
    - Make submit button nicer (same one is used across all screens as of now, so make a component)
    - Implement tab feature (maybe later actually)
    - Added barcode scanner, works fine but does nothing with data read at this point
    - If i decide to change something in viewlog then choose afterwards I don't want this change and leave field blank, then save changes, it will enter that change into the 
    db making that value empty. Example, if I start changing hairColor to grey then choose not to and erase the grey text ive written so field is blank then choose to change 
    age to 27. After saving changes, it will change the age to 27 but also change hairColor to empty. (my temporary solution to this was setting the variable to undefined,
    which works completely fine but maybe check out if theres a way to remove variable from state object)
